#Homework One

For this exercise, you have downloaded a small, but realistic directory structure. You'll find a manuscript folder and an analysis folder, each of which has a back up. The analysis files are phylogenetic trees of a sodium channel we're studying and writing a paper on. We want you to do some exercises, and then save the results into the manuscript folder.

1. Change directories into the homework directory. Type:

```UNIX
ls -R
```

How does the -R flag modify the function of 'ls'?

Try:

```UNIX
ls -F
```

How has the -F flag modified the behavior of ls?

2. Change into the analysis_files folder, and then into one of the subfolders. How many lines are in the tree file in the subfolder?

How many words are in the tree file? Is anything surprising about this? How do you think wc is deciding where a word ends?

3. Change back into the analysis_files folder. Let's say we wanted to run some advanced statistics on these trees, but our analytical software can only accept trees from one file at a time. Concatenate the trees into one text file programmatically. Paste the command you used below.


4. Change directories into the hw_1 directory. Is the analysis_files directory identical to the analysis_backup anymore?

Copy files to the backup as necessary to make them identical.

5. Copy this homework file into the directory manuscript_files. Also copy your concatenated tree file into that directory. 

6. Create a file called 'works_cited.txt'. In a text editor, or nano, write in it "Ben and April, pers. comm."

7. Copy all three of these files simultaneously into manuscript_backup.

8. One last thing. Type:

```UNIX
history
```

And paste the results into this document. Update your backup as needed.
